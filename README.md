# YOLO Robotics Object Detection
Hand-annotated ~3000 images of various FRC robotics field elements, including cones and cubes. Fed image data into computer vision YOLOv5 model for training through TensorFlow framework. Model achieved 95% accuracy. Exported model to .tflite format for use in real-time camera detection on the field.
